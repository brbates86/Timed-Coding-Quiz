# Timed-Coding-Quiz

In this weeks challenge we were given the objective to create a timed coding quiz. I began with creating the structure of the application using HTML. after creating the structure of the application I styled it with CSS giving it a unique style and coloring of my choice. I was then tasked to apply javascript to the timed quiz. This was a very challenging week for me. Having to build it completely from scratch real stretched my brain and thinking capacity.
Here is the link to the application: https://brbates86.github.io/Timed-Coding-Quiz/
